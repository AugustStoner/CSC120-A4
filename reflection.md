- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Encapsulation simplifies some parts of programming for me, but it can be more complicated to keep track of which classes have methods for specific functions.
The relationship between Car and Passenger was very logical, but whether a passenger should be able to ask to board a Train more generally isn't addressed. If I was developing these classes outside of the context provided, I would consider whether a Train should be able to check the availability of space on its cars and return the first Car with space to a passenger attempting to board. 
I think I might still have some confusion on how the finished Engine class should be set up, but I believe it contains all of the functions it is supposed to. 
Talking to Ab in office hours was helpful for figuring out the myCars arrayList, as I was unsure about accessing by index as an option, since I feel I have mainly used objects' names to identify them so far.
